# Data Science & Business Analytics Tasks


## TASK 6

Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. 

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2G6sYx9
