Data Science  &amp; Business  Analytics  Tasks

TASK 1

Prediction using Supervised ML 
(Level - Beginner)

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/2HxiGGJ

TASK 2

Prediction using Unsupervised ML
(Level - Beginner)

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. 

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Sample Solution : https://bit.ly/3cGyP8


TASK 4

Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
(Level - Intermediate)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’ 

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? 

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

TASK 6

Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
